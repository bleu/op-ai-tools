The Code of Conduct Council (CoCC) town hall serves as a platform for discussing the election of council members and addressing community concerns regarding conduct violations. During the town hall, self-nominated candidates present their qualifications and respond to questions from the community. The event is structured to facilitate discussions about past conduct cases and the council's key performance indicators (KPIs) [1][4]. This approach aims to enhance transparency and community engagement in the governance process.
