Establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of funded projects, emphasizing outcomes rather than just activities. The community has suggested using external tools for data collection and evaluation, such as Hypercerts, to enhance the assessment process. Transparency in the voting and evaluation of projects is also essential to ensure fair and informed decision-making [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-round-design/6802  \n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-round-2-voting-rationale/5570  \n[3] https://gov.optimism.io/t/measuring-impact-data-driven-content-performance/6092  \n[4] https://gov.optimism.io/t/lefteris-rpgf-3-voting-rationale-learnings-and-feedback/7213  \n[5] https://gov.optimism.io/t/enhancing-retropgf-with-optimism-fractal/7175  \n[6] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-pgf-impact-profit-framework/7034  \n[7] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-pgf-3-impact-evaluation-framework/7037  \n[8] https://gov.optimism.io/t/evaluation-of-grant-processes/4264  \n",

Some members feel that the punishments for conflicts of interest may be excessively harsh and advocate for clearer definitions of what constitutes such conflicts. There are also calls for a more decentralized approach to handling violations, as well as worries that strict enforcement could discourage transparency among community members. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the processes for reporting violations, with suggestions for a more efficient and transparent system. The establishment of a Code of Conduct Council has been proposed to enhance the handling of violations and ensure that community members feel their concerns are adequately addressed [1][2][3].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://gov.optimism.io/t/retropgf-3-conflicts-of-interest-season-5-citizens/7506  \n[2] https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-violation-carlos-melgar/6882  \n[3] https://gov.optimism.io/t/code-of-conduct-council-retrospective-season-5/8064  \n",
