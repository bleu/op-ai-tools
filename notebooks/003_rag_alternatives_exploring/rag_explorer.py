# RAG Structures Explorer

This notebook is used to explore the different structures of RAG models. 
- We will be using the OpenAI API for embeddings and chat models. 
- We will be using the Anthropic API for the Claude chat model. 
- We will be using the FAISS vectorstore for storing the embeddings. 
- We will be using the Weave library for tracking the metrics.
